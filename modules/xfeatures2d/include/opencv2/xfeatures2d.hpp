/** @brief Class implementing the FREAK (*Fast Retina Keypoint*) keypoint descriptor, described in @cite AOV12 .

The algorithm propose a novel keypoint descriptor inspired by the human visual system and more
precisely the retina, coined Fast Retina Key- point (FREAK). A cascade of binary strings is
computed by efficiently comparing image intensities over a retinal sampling pattern. FREAKs are in
general faster to compute with lower memory load and also more robust than SIFT, SURF or BRISK.
They are competitive alternatives to existing keypoints in particular for embedded applications.

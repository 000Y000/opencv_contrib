Objectness Algorithms
============================

.. highlight:: cpp

Objectness is usually represented as a value which reflects how likely an image window covers an object of any category. Algorithms belonging to this category, avoid making decisions early on, by proposing a small number of category-independent proposals, that are expected to cover all objects in an image. Being able to perceive objects before identifying them is closely related to bottom up visual attention (saliency)

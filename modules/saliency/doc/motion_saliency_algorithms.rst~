Motion Saliency Algorithms
============================

.. highlight:: cpp

Algorithms belonging to this category, are particularly focused to detect salient objects over time (hence also over frame), then there is a temporal component sealing cosider that allows to detect "moving" objects as salient, meaning therefore also the more general sense of detection the changes in the scene.
